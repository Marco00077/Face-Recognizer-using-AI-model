# Face-Recognizer-using-AI-model
This project focuses on developing a robust and efficient face recognition system using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly deep learning. The system aims to identify and authenticate individuals based on their facial features, which have wide applications in security, surveillance, and identity verification.

The core of the project revolves around training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, capable of accurately distinguishing between different faces, even in challenging scenarios like varied lighting conditions, facial expressions, and angles. The project will evaluate various AI-based methods for face recognition, such as VGG-Face, FaceNet, and MTCNN, using large datasets to enhance the modelâ€™s accuracy.

By leveraging modern AI algorithms, the system aims to achieve high precision and reliability in real-world applications. The project will also explore optimization techniques to ensure that the model performs efficiently in terms of both speed and accuracy.
